# Basic Sentiment Analysis

## Context
This repo is just to show how to apply a simple basic analysis.

The script is based on a pretrained backbone taken from **keras NPL** models, especifically the **BertClassifier**.

This makes:
1. The script very easy to build
2. The processing very fast, not even needing GPUs.
